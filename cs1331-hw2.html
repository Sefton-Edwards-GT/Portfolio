                <p>For my project, I designed and implemented a 7-segment display clock using SystemVerilog, with the aim of expanding my knowledge in digital design and gaining practical experience with FPGAs. This project was motivated by my desire to develop skills that are highly relevant to the semiconductor industry and to create a tangible example of my abilities to show potential employers. By combining coding, hardware integration, and learning new tools, I sought to challenge myself and bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.</p>

                            <h2>Problem</h2>
                            <p>The main challenges I faced were twofold: first, gaining proficiency in SystemVerilog, a hardware description language I had little prior experience with, and second, working with FPGAs, which required learning not only the hardware programming workflow but also identifying suitable tutorials and acquiring the necessary software and materials. These obstacles made the project more difficult but also highlighted the areas where I needed to focus my learning.</p>

                            <h2>Action</h2>
                            <p>To overcome these challenges, I broke the project into smaller, manageable tasks. I started by studying basic SystemVerilog concepts through online tutorials and documentation, then experimented with simple modules before attempting the full clock implementation. I also researched FPGA development boards, installed the required software, and set up the hardware environment to ensure I could test and debug the code effectively.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: -1em;">Process</h2>

                    <p>The project development involved writing SystemVerilog code to generate a clock signal and drive a 7-segment display. I iteratively tested each component, starting with the basic timing circuits and incrementally building toward the complete clock functionality. Each stage involved synthesizing the design on the FPGA, checking the output, and making adjustments based on observed behavior. This hands-on approach reinforced my understanding of hardware description languages and digital logic.</p>

                            <h2>Result</h2>
                            <p>The final outcome was a functional 7-segment display clock that successfully demonstrated my ability to design, code, and implement a digital system on an FPGA. Through this project, I not only achieved my goal of creating a working clock but also gained valuable hands-on experience with SystemVerilog and FPGA development. The completed project serves as a concrete example of my technical skills for future opportunities in the semiconductor industry.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;">Reflection</h2>
                <p>Reflecting on the project, I realized the importance of breaking complex problems into smaller steps and being persistent in learning new tools. Although I encountered difficulties with tutorials and hardware setup, working through these challenges significantly improved my problem-solving and technical skills. This experience also reinforced my enthusiasm for digital design and hardware programming, giving me confidence that I can tackle increasingly complex projects in the semiconductor field.</p>
